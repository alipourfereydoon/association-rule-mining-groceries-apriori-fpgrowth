# association-rule-mining-groceries-apriori-fpgrowth
This project applies association rule mining techniques to the Groceries Market Basket Dataset using Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms. It discovers frequent itemsets and strong purchasing patterns, and compares both methods based on support, confidence, lift, and runtime performance.
